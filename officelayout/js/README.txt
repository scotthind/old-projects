NOTE: Files without descriptions (and OpenLayers.js) are holdovers from the
	  old project. We have not altered these in any
	  way, shape or form and are indeed hazy on what some of
	  them DO (they did not need to be changed for this project).
	  I have therefore provided descriptions only for those that
	  we actually edited in some way (and the OpenLayers framework).
